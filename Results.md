# Results

## Count Matrix
Gene expression counts were successfully generated for chromosome 21.

## Log2 Fold Change
Log2 fold change values were computed to assess relative expression differences
between conditions.

## Visualizations
- **Heatmap**: displays expression patterns across samples
- **MA plot**: shows expression bias and fold change
- **Log2FC plot**: highlights expression trends

While full differential testing was limited by sample size, all analytical steps
were successfully executed.
