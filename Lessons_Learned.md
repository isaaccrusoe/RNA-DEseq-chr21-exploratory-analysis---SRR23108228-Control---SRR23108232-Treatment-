# Lessons Learned

This project taught me far more than just RNA-seq commands.

## Technical Lessons
- Importance of quality control before alignment
- Memory-efficient strategies for large genomic datasets
- Proper handling of count matrices and metadata
- Object persistence and reproducibility in R

## Challenges Faced
- Limited RAM and compute power
- Multiple alignment strategies (STAR vs HISAT2)
- R package installation issues across environments
- DESeq2 limitations without biological replicates

## Personal Growth
This project required persistence, adaptability, and continuous troubleshooting.
Despite setbacks, I completed a full RNA-seq workflow and gained confidence
in bioinformatics problem-solving.

This experience prepared me to confidently execute RNA-seq analysis on
larger datasets and better-resourced systems.
